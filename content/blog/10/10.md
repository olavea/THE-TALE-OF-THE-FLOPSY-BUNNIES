![Thomasina Tittlemouse](./11.jpg)

###The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine. The bluebottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.

###(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)
